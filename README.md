# Simulation of Networked control and swarming of robots.
The repository contains all the python codes used to simulate the swarm control of six differential drive robots using pybullet simulation environment. The control algorithm was developed for formation control of robots and target control to move swarm from initial position to target position.Robots form different formation to navigate through through the environment and realize the target.
